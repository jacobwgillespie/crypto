Test crypto repo, idea for a secure communication meshnet running on WebRTC.  Could potentially be embedded in arbitrary websites to increase the available security / network participation.

Allows for third-parties to know that a computer is using the particular system (like TOR), but nothing else.  Severely limits the kind of information able to be passed in order to maintain performance and security guarantees.
